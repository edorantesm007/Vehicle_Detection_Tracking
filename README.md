# Vehicle_Detection_Tracking
A software pipeline to identify vehicles in a video from a front-facing camera on a car

Python, OpenCV and Jupyter notebook are required.

Notes: The name of the file is “VehicleDetection2”. I used the procedure recommended by my mentor
in order to reduce false positives in the pipeline. https://medium.com/@andreasdaiminger/self-driving-cars-vehicle-detection-e4b95fc82baf
